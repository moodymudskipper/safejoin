safejoin
--------

The package *safejoin* features wrappers around packages *dplyr* and *fuzzyjoin*'s functions to join safely using various checks. It also comes packed with features to select columns, rename them, operate on conflicting ones (coalesce for example), or aggregate the rhs on the joining columns before joining.

Install package with:

``` r
# install.packages(devtools)
devtools::install_github("moodymudskipper/safejoin")
```

Joining operations often come with tests, one might want to check that:

1.  `by` columns are given explicitly (*dplyr* displays a message if they're not)
2.  Factor columns used for the join have the same levels (*dplyr* displays a warning if they don't)
3.  No columns are repeated in both data.frames apart from `by` columns (*dplyr* keeps them both and suffixes them silently)
4.  Join columns form a unique key on both or either tables
5.  All rows of both or either tables will be matched
6.  All combinations of values of join columns are present on both or either sides
7.  columns used for joins have same class and type

This package provides the possibility to ignore, inform, warn or abort for any of combination of these cases.

These checks are handled by a single string parameter, i.e. a sequence of characters where uppercase letters trigger failures, lower case letters trigger warnings, and letters prefixed with `~` trigger messages, the codes are as follow:

-   `"c"` to check *c*onflicts of *c*olumns
-   `"b"` like *"by"* checks if `by` parameter was given explicitly
-   `"u"` like *unique* to check that the join columns form an unique key on `x`
-   `"v"` to check that the join columns form an unique key on `y`
-   `"m"` like *match* to check that all rows of `x` have a *match*
-   `"n"` to check that all rows of `y` have a *match*
-   `"e"` like *expand* to check that all combinations of joining columns are present in `x`
-   `"f"` to check that all combinations of joining columns are present in `y`
-   `"l"` like *levels* to check that join columns are consistent in term of factor levels
-   `"t"` like *type* to check that joining columns have same class and type

For example, `check = "MN"` will ensure that all rows of both tables are matched.

Additionally when identically named columns are present on both sides, we can aggregate them into one in flexible ways (including coalesce or just keeping one of them). This is done through the `conflict` parameter.

The package features functions `safe_left_join`, `safe_right_join`, `safe_inner_join`, `safe_full_join`, `safe_nest_join`, `safe_semi_join`, `safe_anti_join`, and `eat`.

The additional function, `eat` is designed to be an improved join in the cases where one is growing a data frame. In addition to the features above :

-   It uses the `...` argument to select columns from `.y` and leverages the select helpers from *dplyr*, allowing also things like renaming, negative selection, quasi-quotation...
-   It can prefix new columns or rename them in a flexible way
-   It can summarize `.y` on the fly along joining columns for more concise and readable code
-   It can join recursively to a list of tables

The support of `fuzzyjoin` functions is done in two ways, `fuzzyjoin` functions will be used instead of `dplyr`'s functions if :

-   The argument `match_fun` is filled. Then the standard `fuzzyjoin` interface is leveraged, except that `safejoin` supports formula notation for this argument.
-   A formula argument is provided to the `by` argument. It should use a notation like `~ X("var1") > Y("var2") & X("var3") < Y("var4")`. This was introduced to avoid using the arguments `multi_by` and `multi_match_fun` from `fuzzyjoin::fuzzy_join` which I felt were confusing, and have a single readable argument instead.

safe\_left\_join
----------------

*safejoin* offers the same features for all `safe_*_join` functions so we'll only review `safe_left_join` here, we also limit ourselves to checks of the form `~*`

We'll use *dplyr*'s data sets `band_members` and `band_instruments` along with extended versions.

``` r
library(safejoin)
library(dplyr,quietly = TRUE,warn.conflicts = FALSE)
band_members_extended <- band_members %>%
  mutate(cooks = factor(c("pasta","pizza","spaghetti"),
                        levels = c("pasta","pizza","spaghetti"))) %>%
  add_row(name = "John",band = "The Who", cooks = "pizza")

band_instruments_extended <- band_instruments %>%
  mutate(cooks = factor(c("pizza","pasta","pizza")))

band_members
#> # A tibble: 3 x 2
#>   name  band   
#>   <chr> <chr>  
#> 1 Mick  Stones 
#> 2 John  Beatles
#> 3 Paul  Beatles
band_instruments
#> # A tibble: 3 x 2
#>   name  plays 
#>   <chr> <chr> 
#> 1 John  guitar
#> 2 Paul  bass  
#> 3 Keith guitar
band_members_extended
#> # A tibble: 4 x 3
#>   name  band    cooks    
#>   <chr> <chr>   <fct>    
#> 1 Mick  Stones  pasta    
#> 2 John  Beatles pizza    
#> 3 Paul  Beatles spaghetti
#> 4 John  The Who pizza
band_instruments_extended
#> # A tibble: 3 x 3
#>   name  plays  cooks
#>   <chr> <chr>  <fct>
#> 1 John  guitar pizza
#> 2 Paul  bass   pasta
#> 3 Keith guitar pizza
```

Not applying any check :

``` r
safe_left_join(band_members,
               band_instruments,
               check = "")
#> # A tibble: 3 x 3
#>   name  band    plays 
#>   <chr> <chr>   <chr> 
#> 1 Mick  Stones  <NA>  
#> 2 John  Beatles guitar
#> 3 Paul  Beatles bass
```

Displaying "Joining, by..." like in default *dplyr* behavior:

``` r
safe_left_join(band_members,
               band_instruments,
               check = "~b")
#> Joining, by = "name"
#> # A tibble: 3 x 3
#>   name  band    plays 
#>   <chr> <chr>   <chr> 
#> 1 Mick  Stones  <NA>  
#> 2 John  Beatles guitar
#> 3 Paul  Beatles bass
```

Check column conflict when joining extended datasets by name:

``` r
try(safe_left_join(band_members_extended,
                   band_instruments_extended,
                   by = "name",
                   check = "~c"))
#> Conflict of columns: cooks
#> # A tibble: 4 x 5
#>   name  band    cooks.x   plays  cooks.y
#>   <chr> <chr>   <fct>     <chr>  <fct>  
#> 1 Mick  Stones  pasta     <NA>   <NA>   
#> 2 John  Beatles pizza     guitar pizza  
#> 3 Paul  Beatles spaghetti bass   pasta  
#> 4 John  The Who pizza     guitar pizza
```

Check if `x` has unmatched combinations:

``` r
safe_left_join(band_members_extended,
               band_instruments_extended,
               by = c("name","cooks"),
               check = "~m")
#> x has unmatched sets of joining values: 
#>  # A tibble: 2 x 2
#>   name  cooks

#> 1 Mick  pasta    
#> 2 Paul  spaghetti
#> # A tibble: 4 x 4

#> 2 John  Beatles pizza     guitar
#> 3 Paul  Beatles spaghetti <NA>  
#> 4 John  The Who pizza     guitar
```

Check if `y` has unmatched combinations:

``` r
safe_left_join(band_members_extended,
               band_instruments_extended,
               by = c("name","cooks"),
               check = "~n")
#> y has unmatched sets of joining values:

#> 2 John  Beatles pizza     guitar
#> 3 Paul  Beatles spaghetti <NA>  
#> 4 John  The Who pizza     guitar
```

Check if `x` has absent combinations:

``` r
safe_left_join(band_members_extended,
               band_instruments_extended,
               by = c("name","cooks"),
               check = "~e")
#> Some combinations of joining values are absent from x: 
#> %s # A tibble: 6 x 2

#>   <chr> <chr>    
#> 1 John  pasta    
#> 2 Paul  pasta    
#> 3 Mick  pizza    
#> 4 Paul  pizza    
#> 5 Mick  spaghetti
#> 6 John  spaghetti

#> 2 John  Beatles pizza     guitar
#> 3 Paul  Beatles spaghetti <NA>  
#> 4 John  The Who pizza     guitar
```

Check if `y` has absent combinations:

``` r
safe_left_join(band_members_extended,
               band_instruments_extended,
               by = c("name","cooks"),
               check = "~f")
#> Some combinations of joining values are absent from y: 
#> %s # A tibble: 3 x 2
#>   name  cooks
#>   <chr> <chr>
#> 1 Paul  pizza
#> 2 John  pasta
#> 3 Keith pasta
#> # A tibble: 4 x 4
#>   name  band    cooks     plays 
#>   <chr> <chr>   <chr>     <chr>

#> 2 John  Beatles pizza     guitar
#> 3 Paul  Beatles spaghetti <NA>  
#> 4 John  The Who pizza     guitar
```

Check if `x` is unique on joining columns:

``` r
safe_left_join(band_members_extended,
               band_instruments_extended,
               by = c("name","cooks"),
               check = "~u")
#> x is not unique on name and cooks
#> # A tibble: 4 x 4
#>   name  band    cooks     plays 
#>   <chr> <chr>   <chr>     <chr> 
#> 1 Mick  Stones  pasta     <NA>  
#> 2 John  Beatles pizza     guitar
#> 3 Paul  Beatles spaghetti <NA>  
#> 4 John  The Who pizza     guitar
```

Check if `y` is unique on joining columns (it is):

``` r
safe_left_join(band_members_extended,
               band_instruments_extended,
               by = c("name","cooks"),
               check = "~v")
#> # A tibble: 4 x 4
#>   name  band    cooks     plays 
#>   <chr> <chr>   <chr>     <chr> 
#> 1 Mick  Stones  pasta     <NA>  
#> 2 John  Beatles pizza     guitar
#> 3 Paul  Beatles spaghetti <NA>  
#> 4 John  The Who pizza     guitar
```

Check if levels are compatible betweeb joining columns:

``` r
safe_left_join(band_members_extended,
               band_instruments_extended,
               by = c("name","cooks"),
               check = "~l")
#> The pair cooks/cooks don't have the same levels:
#> x: pasta, pizza, spaghetti
#> y: pasta, pizza
#> They'll be coerced to character
#> # A tibble: 4 x 4
#>   name  band    cooks     plays 
#>   <chr> <chr>   <chr>     <chr> 
#> 1 Mick  Stones  pasta     <NA>  
#> 2 John  Beatles pizza     guitar
#> 3 Paul  Beatles spaghetti <NA>  
#> 4 John  The Who pizza     guitar
```

In case of confict, choose either the column from `x` or from `y`:

``` r
safe_left_join(band_members_extended,
               band_instruments_extended, by = "name",
               conflict = ~.x)
#> # A tibble: 4 x 4
#>   name  band    cooks     plays 
#>   <chr> <chr>   <fct>     <chr> 
#> 1 Mick  Stones  pasta     <NA>  
#> 2 John  Beatles pizza     guitar
#> 3 Paul  Beatles spaghetti bass  
#> 4 John  The Who pizza     guitar

safe_left_join(band_members_extended,
               band_instruments_extended, 
               by = "name", 
               conflict = ~.y)
#> # A tibble: 4 x 4
#>   name  band    cooks plays 
#>   <chr> <chr>   <fct> <chr> 
#> 1 Mick  Stones  <NA>  <NA>  
#> 2 John  Beatles pizza guitar
#> 3 Paul  Beatles pasta bass  
#> 4 John  The Who pizza guitar
```

Or coalesce them :

``` r
safe_left_join(band_members_extended, 
               band_instruments_extended, 
               by = "name", conflict = coalesce)
#> # A tibble: 4 x 4
#>   name  band    cooks     plays 
#>   <chr> <chr>   <fct>     <chr> 
#> 1 Mick  Stones  pasta     <NA>  
#> 2 John  Beatles pizza     guitar
#> 3 Paul  Beatles spaghetti bass  
#> 4 John  The Who pizza     guitar
safe_left_join(band_members_extended, 
               band_instruments_extended, 
               by = "name", conflict = ~coalesce(.y,.x))
#> # A tibble: 4 x 4
#>   name  band    cooks plays 
#>   <chr> <chr>   <fct> <chr> 
#> 1 Mick  Stones  pasta <NA>  
#> 2 John  Beatles pizza guitar
#> 3 Paul  Beatles pasta bass  
#> 4 John  The Who pizza guitar
```

Or do any custom transformation :

``` r
safe_left_join(band_members_extended, 
               band_instruments_extended, 
               by = "name", conflict = paste)
#> # A tibble: 4 x 4
#>   name  band    cooks           plays 
#>   <chr> <chr>   <chr>           <chr> 
#> 1 Mick  Stones  pasta NA        <NA>  
#> 2 John  Beatles pizza pizza     guitar
#> 3 Paul  Beatles spaghetti pasta bass  
#> 4 John  The Who pizza pizza     guitar
```

Some common use cases for numerics would be `` confict = `+` ``, `confict = pmin`, , `confict = pmax`, `confict = ~(.x+.y)/2`.

`conflict = "patch"` is a special value where matches found in `y` overwrite the values in `x`, and other values are kept. It's different from `conflict = ~coalesce(.y,.x)` because some values in `x` might be overwritten by `NA`.

``` r
safe_left_join(band_members_extended, 
               band_instruments_extended,
               by = "name", conflict = "patch")
#> # A tibble: 4 x 4
#>   name  band    cooks plays 
#>   <chr> <chr>   <fct> <chr> 
#> 1 Mick  Stones  pasta <NA>  
#> 2 John  Beatles pizza guitar
#> 3 Paul  Beatles pasta bass  
#> 4 John  The Who pizza guitar
```

eat
---

All the checks above are still relevant for `eat`, we'll silence them below with `check=""` to focus on the additional features.

Same as `safe_left_join` :

``` r
band_members_extended %>% 
  eat(band_instruments_extended)
#> Joining, by = c("name", "cooks")
#> Warning: The pair cooks/cooks don't have the same levels:
#> x: pasta, pizza, spaghetti
#> y: pasta, pizza
#> They'll be coerced to character
#> # A tibble: 4 x 4
#>   name  band    cooks     plays 
#>   <chr> <chr>   <chr>     <chr> 
#> 1 Mick  Stones  pasta     <NA>  
#> 2 John  Beatles pizza     guitar
#> 3 Paul  Beatles spaghetti <NA>  
#> 4 John  The Who pizza     guitar
band_members_extended %>% 
  eat(band_instruments_extended, .by = "name", .check = "")
#> # A tibble: 4 x 5
#>   name  band    cooks.x   plays  cooks.y
#>   <chr> <chr>   <fct>     <chr>  <fct>  
#> 1 Mick  Stones  pasta     <NA>   <NA>   
#> 2 John  Beatles pizza     guitar pizza  
#> 3 Paul  Beatles spaghetti bass   pasta  
#> 4 John  The Who pizza     guitar pizza
```

The names of `eat`'s parameters start with a dot to minimize the risk of conflict when naming the arguments fed to the `...`. The `...` are usually used to pass columns to be eaten, but they are passed to `select` so more features are available.

Select which column to eat:

``` r
band_members_extended %>% 
  eat(band_instruments_extended, plays, .by = "name", .check = "")
#> # A tibble: 4 x 4
#>   name  band    cooks     plays 
#>   <chr> <chr>   <fct>     <chr> 
#> 1 Mick  Stones  pasta     <NA>  
#> 2 John  Beatles pizza     guitar
#> 3 Paul  Beatles spaghetti bass  
#> 4 John  The Who pizza     guitar
band_members_extended %>% 
  eat(band_instruments_extended, -cooks, .by = "name", .check = "")
#> # A tibble: 4 x 4
#>   name  band    cooks     plays 
#>   <chr> <chr>   <fct>     <chr> 
#> 1 Mick  Stones  pasta     <NA>  
#> 2 John  Beatles pizza     guitar
#> 3 Paul  Beatles spaghetti bass  
#> 4 John  The Who pizza     guitar
band_members_extended %>% 
  eat(band_instruments_extended, starts_with("p"), .by = "name", .check = "")
#> # A tibble: 4 x 4
#>   name  band    cooks     plays 
#>   <chr> <chr>   <fct>     <chr> 
#> 1 Mick  Stones  pasta     <NA>  
#> 2 John  Beatles pizza     guitar
#> 3 Paul  Beatles spaghetti bass  
#> 4 John  The Who pizza     guitar
```

Rename eaten columns :

``` r
band_members_extended %>% 
  eat(band_instruments_extended, .prefix = "NEW", .check = "")
#> # A tibble: 4 x 4
#>   name  band    cooks     NEW_plays
#>   <chr> <chr>   <chr>     <chr>    
#> 1 Mick  Stones  pasta     <NA>     
#> 2 John  Beatles pizza     guitar   
#> 3 Paul  Beatles spaghetti <NA>     
#> 4 John  The Who pizza     guitar
band_members_extended %>% 
  eat(band_instruments_extended, PLAYS = plays, .check = "")
#> # A tibble: 4 x 4
#>   name  band    cooks     PLAYS 
#>   <chr> <chr>   <chr>     <chr> 
#> 1 Mick  Stones  pasta     <NA>  
#> 2 John  Beatles pizza     guitar
#> 3 Paul  Beatles spaghetti <NA>  
#> 4 John  The Who pizza     guitar
```

We can check if the dot argument was used by using the character `"d"` in the check string:

``` r
band_members_extended %>% 
  eat(band_instruments_extended, .check = "~d")
#> Column names not provided, all columns from y will be eaten :
#> plays
#> # A tibble: 4 x 4
#>   name  band    cooks     plays 
#>   <chr> <chr>   <chr>     <chr> 
#> 1 Mick  Stones  pasta     <NA>  
#> 2 John  Beatles pizza     guitar
#> 3 Paul  Beatles spaghetti <NA>  
#> 4 John  The Who pizza     guitar
```

In cases of matching to many (i.e. the join columns don't form a unique key for `y`), we can use the parameter `.agg` to aggregate them on the fly:

``` r
band_instruments_extended %>% 
  eat(band_members_extended, .check = "")
#> # A tibble: 4 x 4
#>   name  plays  cooks band   
#>   <chr> <chr>  <chr> <chr>  
#> 1 John  guitar pizza Beatles
#> 2 John  guitar pizza The Who
#> 3 Paul  bass   pasta <NA>   
#> 4 Keith guitar pizza <NA>
band_instruments_extended %>% 
  eat(band_members_extended, .agg = ~paste(.,collapse="/"), .check = "")
#> # A tibble: 3 x 4
#>   name  plays  cooks band           
#>   <chr> <chr>  <chr> <chr>          
#> 1 John  guitar pizza Beatles/The Who
#> 2 Paul  bass   pasta <NA>           
#> 3 Keith guitar pizza <NA>
```

Finally we can eat a list of data frames at once, and optionally override the `.prefix` argument by providing names to the elements.

``` r
X <- data.frame(a = 1:2,b = 1:2)
Y1 <- list(data.frame(a = 1:2,c = 3:4), data.frame(a = 1:2,d = 5:6))
eat(X, Y1)
#> Joining, by = "a"
#> 
#> Joining, by = "a"
#>   a b c d
#> 1 1 1 3 5
#> 2 2 2 4 6

Y2 <- list(data.frame(a = 1:2,c = c(3,NA)), data.frame(a = 1:2,c = c(NA,4)))
eat(X, Y2, .by = "a", .conflict = coalesce)
#>   a b c
#> 1 1 1 3
#> 2 2 2 4

Y3 <- list(FOO = data.frame(a = 1:2,c = 3:4), BAR = data.frame(a = 1:2,d = 5:6))
eat(X, Y3)
#> Joining, by = "a"
#> 
#> Joining, by = "a"
#>   a b FOO_c BAR_d
#> 1 1 1     3     5
#> 2 2 2     4     6

Y4 <- list(FOO = data.frame(a = 1:2, c = 3:4, d = 5:6), 
           BAR = data.frame(a = 1:2, c = 3:4, e = 7:8))
eat(X, Y4)
#> Joining, by = "a"
#> 
#> Joining, by = "a"
#>   a b FOO_c FOO_d BAR_c BAR_e
#> 1 1 1     3     5     3     7
#> 2 2 2     4     6     4     8
eat(X, Y4, c)
#> Joining, by = "a"
#> 
#> Joining, by = "a"
#>   a b FOO_c BAR_c
#> 1 1 1     3     3
#> 2 2 2     4     4
```
